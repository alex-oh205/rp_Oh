                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft" id="">When there is a temperature difference across a material, a voltage is generated due to the movement and concentration of charges—this is known as the Seebeck effect, the core principle behind thermoelectric generators. The reverse process, where electricity creates a temperature difference, is called the Peltier effect, used in thermoelectric coolers.

The efficiency of thermoelectric materials is largely determined by the Seebeck coefficient (S), which measures how much voltage is generated per unit of temperature difference. Better thermoelectric materials have a high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity (σ), and low thermal conductivity (κ). These factors are combined in the figure of merit (ZT = S²σT/κ). The power factor (S²σ) is a simpler performance metric often used.

Recent research has found that some of the best thermoelectric materials are also topological insulators (TIs)—materials that conduct electricity on their surfaces but not internally. It is unknown whether these surface states enhance thermoelectric performance. Notable examples include bismuth telluride (Bi₂Te₃) and bismuth selenide (Bi₂Se₃), the latter being the focus of this study.</p>

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft" id="">Most processes on Earth produce thermal energy as waste, such as the heat from large data centers. Capturing this waste heat and converting it into usable electricity could greatly improve energy efficiency. Traditional methods like steam generators are not ideal for this purpose—they are large, inefficient for waste heat, and may cause pollution. Thermoelectric materials can directly convert heat into electricity without harmful byproducts, offering a much better alternative. They are also clean, efficient, and lightweight, making them suitable for scalable energy recovery. Harvesting waste heat energy has not attracted much attention from the public so far. However, with the emergence of large-scale data centers that dump a significant amount of heat into the environment, it is becoming important to find a way to effectively recover waste heat energy. Using thermoelectrics could be one of the most efficient ways to accomplish this. The present study helps reveal the relationship between topological insulators and thermoelectricity, paving the way toward the development of better thermoelectric materials.</p>

                        <p class="lead overview-font ovPadLeft" id="">This project was made possible through High Technology High School's Research Practicum course. In this course, students engage in hands-on research experiences, working closely with mentors to explore the scientific process and discover new knowledge through experimentation. For an entire semester, students are given time to conduct their experiments and statistically analyze their results. Students present their findings along with writing a research paper at the end of the program, showcasing their hard work and dedication to advancing scientific understanding. Approximately 50% of the class then goes on to compete in various research competitions.</p>
